Week 10_Assignment 8 - Combinational Logic Gates

Q1
68 Points
For both questions. you will be able to see immediate feedback from the website for each gate you build up: a message "Level successfully completed", which means you will receive full- points for the gate, regardless how many components you use.

The ﬁrst question is a lab exercise to build all the gates covered in lectures. Please complete all following logic gates on nandgame website, except Less than Zero.

 
Please upload a screenshot for each gate which shows (1) how you build the gate and (2) the message of "Level successfully completed" in order to receive full points. You are highly encouraged to watch the lectures ﬁrst, then turn it oﬀ and build all these gates on your own, although you can complete this assignment while following through the video step-by-step. You are advised to practice and understand the steps to the point you can conﬁdently reproduce them on your own in order to prepare for exams

Q2
40 Points
In this question, you will implement some gates on your own. Feel free to be creative!

You are only required to implement Nor gate, Xnor gate, Left shift and Max gate.

Again, you will be able to see immediate feedback from the website: "Level successfully completed", which means you will receive full-points for the gate, regardless how many components you use.
